### Hello world!

This site exists to help you make the most of `Hacktoberfest`, which typically occurs on GitHub during the month of October. Information for the current year is typically available on the [Hacktoberfest website](https://hacktoberfest.com/).

# Hacktoberfest: A HOWTO

This repo contains tips for two sets of folks: 
* Repo owners that create issues and handle incoming pull requests
* Hacktoberfest participants that want to use the allure of an evolving digital badge to try out contributing to open source.
